This homework uses **Colab T4**.

## data dirs
Please connect your Colab to your Google Drive first and upload the training data to your Drive. Then, modify the following line
`os.chdir('/content/drive/MyDrive/divl/CVPDL/hw1/')` to match your own path, or follow the default directory structure.

## run the file
- You could follow every section and execute them.
- You could choose just one preprocessing between section **patch training** and **convert to yolo** to convert your data to yolo formation.
